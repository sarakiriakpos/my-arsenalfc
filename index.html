		<div style="float: center; width: 100%"><p><strong>Arsenal Football Club</strong> is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England, that plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The club has won <i>13 League titles, a record 13 FA Cups, 2 League Cups,15 <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Cities_Fairs_Cup">FA Community Shields</a>, 1 League Centenary Trophy, 1 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and 1 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.</i></p>
	<p>Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League, in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970%E2%80%9371_in_English_football">1970-71</a>, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.</p></div>
	<p><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Chapman" target="_blank">Herbert Chapman</a> won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers,[6] and added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's kit. <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Wenger" target="_blank">Arsène Wenger</a> was the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record 7 FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.</p>
	<p>In 1886, Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. In terms of revenue, <b>Arsenal is the ninth highest-earning football club in the world,</b> <i>earned €487.6m in 2016–17 season.</i> <br /> Based on social media activity from 2014 to 2015, Arsenal's fanbase is the fifth largest in the world. In 2018, Forbes estimated the club was the third most valuable in England, with the club being worth $2.24 billion.</p>

	<p>In October 1886, Scotsman <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Danskin" target="_blank"> David Danskin</a> and his fellow 15 munitions workers in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolwich"> Woolwich</a>, now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with each member contributing sixpence and Danskin adding another three shillings to help form the club. Named after the heart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Arsenal"> Royal Arsenal</a> complex, they took the name of the whole complex a month later. Royal Arsenal F.C.'s first home was Plumstead Common, though they spent most of their time in South East London playing on the other side of Plumstead, at the Manor Ground. Royal Arsenal won Arsenal's first trophies in 1890 and 1891, and these were the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_football_association"> football association</a> trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London. In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.</p>
	<p>Royal Arsenal renamed themselves for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Football_League"> The Football League</a> when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League, starting out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Second_Division"> Second Division</a> and winning promotion to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division"> First Division</a> in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910. Businessmen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_(businessman)"> Henry Norris</a> and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.</p>
	<p>In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Woolwich Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, North London. This saw their third change of name: the following year, they reduced Woolwich Arsenal to simply The Arsenal. In 1919, The Football League voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First Division, despite only listing the club sixth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of 1914–15. Some books have speculated that the club won this election to division one by dubious means.[b] Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping "The" in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.</p>
